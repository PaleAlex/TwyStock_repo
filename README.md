# Twystocker - repo

This is the repo for all ORIGINAL tweets (retweet excluded) counts coming from Twitter.
update: since Twitter became X, my API keys has been blocked, so that the service is no longer available for collecting new data

The tweets are about the most cited stocks in [WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) sub-reddit.

Columns are:
 - $tag (filter used for the search)
 - day in the format %Y-%m-&d
 - timestamp of the first tweet retrieved in a specific day (UTC+0)
 - timestamp of the last tweet retrieved in a specific day (UTC+0)
 - tweets count
